[00:13.62] Someone told me long ago
[00:17.71] There's a calm before the storm
[00:20.99] I know, it's been comin' for some time
[00:39.99] 
[00:30.01] When it's over, so they say
[00:34.44] It'll rain a sunny day
[00:37.27] I know, shinin' down like water
[00:52.77] 
[00:47.15] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[00:55.52] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[01:03.72] Comin' down on a sunny day?
[01:17.22] 
[01:11.78] Yesterday and days before
[01:15.89] Sun is cold and rain is hard
[01:18.81] I know, been that way for all my time
[01:37.31] 
[01:28.23] 'Til forever on it goes
[01:32.26] Through the circle, fast and slow
[01:35.16] I know, it can't stop, I wonder
[01:50.66] 
[01:45.09] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[01:53.42] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[02:01.58] Comin' down on a sunny day?
[02:06.98] Yeah
[02:08.98] 
[02:10.16] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[02:18.23] I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
[02:26.73] Comin' down on a sunny day?
